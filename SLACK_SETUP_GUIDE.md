npm run dev
```

### 6.2 Connect Slack

1. Open WorkLedger in your browser
2. Navigate to **Dashboard > Integrations**

## üîç Step 7: Verify Data is Syncing

### Check Database

```bash

```

Navigate to the following models to verify data:
- `SlackIntegration` - Your workspace connection
- `SlackWorkspace` - Workspace details
- `SlackUser` - Workspace members
- `SlackChannel` - Channels
- `SlackMessage` - Aggregated message data (no content!)

### Check Logs

Watch your console for log messages:
```
‚úÖ Workspace synced: YourWorkspaceName
‚úÖ Synced 42 users (38 matched to employees)
‚úÖ Synced 25 channels
‚úÖ Synced and aggregated messages (1,234 total)
```

## üé® Step 8: Add to Dashboard (Optional)

If you want to display the Slack integration card on your dashboard:

### Edit your dashboard page

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (or wherever you want to display it)

```tsx
import { SlackIntegrationCard } from '@/components/slack/slack-integration-card'

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Your other dashboard content */}

      {/* Slack Integration Card */}
      <SlackIntegrationCard />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: OAuth redirect fails

**Solution:**
- Verify your redirect URL matches exactly in:
  - `.env` file (`NEXTAUTH_URL`)
  - Slack App settings
  - No trailing slashes!

### Issue: Webhooks not receiving events

**Solution:**
1. Check Request URL in Slack settings
2. Ensure URL is publicly accessible (use ngrok for local dev)
3. Check that `/api/slack/webhooks` returns `200 OK`
4. Verify Signing Secret in `.env`

### Issue: No users matched to employees

**Solution:**
- Slack users are matched by email
- Ensure employees have the same email in:
  - WorkLedger database
  - Slack profile
- Manually verify emails in Prisma Studio

### Issue: "Failed to exchange code for token"

**Solution:**
- Verify `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` and `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
- Check that credentials are not exposed (no quotes issues)
- Regenerate credentials if compromised
