## Important Notes

1. **Ngrok URL Changes**: Free ngrok URLs change when you restart ngrok. If your URL changes, you'll need to update GitHub App settings again.

2. **Testing Installation Flow**:
   - Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
   - Start ngrok: `ngrok http 3000`
   - Update GitHub App with new ngrok URL (if it changed)
   - Go to your dashboard: http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Connect GitHub Organization"

3. **For Production**: Replace ngrok URL with your production domain (e.g., https://workledger.vercel.app)

## üêõ Bug Fix Summary (October 18, 2025)

### Problem
After installing the GitHub App, users were stuck on the GitHub settings page (`https://github.com/settings/installations/XXXXXX`) instead of being redirected back to the WorkLedger dashboard.

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Leading space in APP_URL** - The `.env` file had `APP_URL=" https://..."` with a leading space
2. **Setup URL not configured** - GitHub App settings didn't have the Setup URL configured
3. **Insufficient logging** - Hard to debug the callback flow

### Fixes Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed `.env` file** - Removed leading space from APP_URL (line 50)
2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced callback logging** - Added comprehensive logging to `/api/github/app/install/route.ts`
3. ‚úÖ **Improved error handling** - Better error messages and explicit 302 redirects
4. ‚úÖ **Added UI feedback** - Success/error alerts on the integration page

### Required Action
‚ö†Ô∏è **YOU MUST DO THIS NOW:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/apps/workledger-app
2. Click "Edit"
3. Scroll to "Setup URL (optional)"
4. Enter: `https://bfbe47065779.ngrok-free.app/api/github/app/install`
5. Click "Save changes"

### Testing the Fix

1. **Start your server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in** as company admin

3. **Go to:** `/dashboard/integrations/github`

4. **Click:** "Install GitHub App"

5. **On GitHub:**
   - Select organization
   - Select repositories
   - Click "Install"

6. **Expected result:**
   - ‚úÖ Redirected back to WorkLedger
   - ‚úÖ Success alert shown
   - ‚úÖ Integration status displayed
   - ‚úÖ Stats updated

### Debugging

If you're still having issues, check the server logs for:
```
=== GITHUB APP INSTALLATION CALLBACK ===
```

This will show you exactly what's happening during the callback.
